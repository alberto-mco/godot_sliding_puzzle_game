# Sliding puzzle game
This is my first game made with godot, it's a sliding puzzle game written in GDScript.

The aim of the game is to put in order all the numbers in the grid.
The correct number order is from left to right and from top to bottom

In the settings screen, you can change the initial shuffle moves, and the grid size.
The grid size can be:
- 3x3
- 4x4
- 5x5

## Important note
The comments inside the code, and the UI elements are written in spanish.
